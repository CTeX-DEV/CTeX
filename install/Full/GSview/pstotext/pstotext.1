.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpstotext\fR reads one or more PostScript or PDF files, and writes to
standard output a representation of the plain text that would be
displayed if the PostScript file were printed.  As is described in the
DETAILS section below, this representation is only an approximation.
Nevertheless, it is often useful for information retrieval (e.g.,
running grep(1) or building a full\-text index) or to recover the text
from a PostScript file whose source you have lost.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR calls Ghostscript, and requires Aladdin Ghostscript
version 3.51 or newer.  Ghostscript must be invokable on the current
search path as gs.  Alternatively, you can use the \-gs option to
specify the command (pathname and options) to run Ghostscript.  For
example, on Windows you might use \-gs "c:\\gs\\gswin32c.exe
\-Ic:\\gs;c:\\gs\\fonts".
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR reads and processes its command line from left to right,
ignoring the case of options.  When it encounters a pathname, it opens
the file and expects to find a PostScript job or PDF document to
process.  The option \- means to read and process a PostScript job from
standard input.  If no \- or pathname arguments are encountered,
\fBpstotext\fR reads a PostScript job from standard input. (PDF
documents require random access, hence cannot be read from standard
input.) You can use the \-output option to specify an output file
(remember to invoke it \fIbefore\fR the input file); otherwise
\fBpstotext\fR writes to standard output.
.PP
The option \-cork is only relevant for PostScript files produced by
dvips from TeX or LaTeX documents; it tells \fBpstotext\fR to use the
Cork encoding (known as T1 in LaTeX) rather than the old TeX text
encoding (known as OT1 in LaTeX). Unfortunately files produced by
dvips don't distinguish which font encodings were used.
.PP
The options \-landscape and \-landscapeOther should be used for
documents that must be rotated 90 degrees clockwise or
counterclockwise, respectively, in order to be readable.
.PP
The options \-debug and \-bboxes are mostly of use for the maintainers
of \fBpstotext\fR.  \-debug shows Ghostscript output and error
messages. \-bboxes outputs one word per line with bounding box
information.
.SH "DETAILS"
\fBpstotext\fR does its work by telling Ghostscript to load a
PostScript library that causes it to write to its standard output
information about each string rendered by a PostScript job or PDF
document.  This information includes the characters of the string, and
enough additional information to approximate the string's bounding
rectangle.  \fBpstotext\fR post\-processes this information and outputs
a sequence of words delimited by space, newline, and formfeed.
.PP
\fBpstotext\fR outputs words in the same sequence as they are rendered
by the document.  This usually, but not always, follows the order that
a human would read the words on a page.  Within this sequence, words
are separated by either space or newline depending on whether or not
they fall on the same line.  Each page is terminated with a formfeed.
If you use the incorrect option from the set {\-portrait, \-landscape,
\-landscapeOther}, \fBpstotext\fR is likely to substitute newline for
space.
.PP
A PostScript job or PDF document often renders one word as several
strings in order to get correct spacing between particular pairs of
characters.  \fBpstotext\fR does its best to assemble these strings
back into words, using a simple heuristic: strings separated by a
distance of less than 0.3 times the minimum of the average character
widths in the two strings are considered to be part of the same word.
Note that this typically causes leading and trailing punctuation
characters to be included with a word.
.PP
The PostScript language provides a flexible encoding scheme by which
character codes in strings select specific characters (symbols), so a
PostScript job is free to use any character code.  On the other hand,
\fBpstotext\fR always translates to the ISO 8859\-1 (Latin\-1) character
code, which is an extension to ASCII covering most of the Western
European languages.  When a character isn't present in ISO 8859\-1,
\fBpstotext\fR uses a sequence of characters, e.g., "\-\-\-" for em dash
or "A\\226" for Abreve.  \fBpstotext\fR can be fooled by a font whose
Encoding vector doesn't follow Adobe's conventions, but it contains
heuristics allowing it to handle a wide variety of misbehaving fonts.
.PP
(\fBpstotext\fR no longer translates hyphen (\\255) to minus (\\055).)
