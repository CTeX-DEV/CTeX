<h1>About WinEdt...</h1>

<p>You don't have to study WinEdt's documentation in order to start working on your TeX documents. The program is ready to go, by default configured for MiKTeX or TeX Live accessories; alternative configurations are easily set through the Options -> Configurations menu. You do, however, need to have your TeX system installed!</p>

<p>The User's Guide explains some important concepts (such as <em>modes</em>, <em>configurations</em> and <em>active strings</em>) that make WinEdt more than just a simple (Notepad-like) editor with a few TeX-related buttons. Still, if (for the time being) you are not interested in such functionality you can ignore these concepts and simply use WinEdt as is.</p>

<p>The <span class="cmd">Configuration Wizard</span>, and the <span class="cmd">Execution Modes</span> and <span class="cmd">Preferences</span> dialogs in the Options menu, can be used to accomplish the most commonly requested customizations. It is strongly recommended that you take a look at those dialogs in order to get an idea what can be easily accomplished. In particular, the Diagnosis tab page in the Execution Modes dialog will help you correctly diagnose and fix any problems with external accessories (such as your TeX System). The <span class="cmd">Options Interface</span> in the same menu should be used to manage numerous WinEdt options and customize the program to any specific needs you may have...</p>

<p>Most WinEdt dialogs provide a context-sensitive help. Press the <span class="cmd">Help</span> button in such dialogs and you'll get relevant information pertaining to the contents of the dialog and the meaning of the available options. This information can be also accessed through the navigation bar (Dialogs...) in this help manual. Again, you don't have to read it until you encounter the need to change something in the defaults...</p>

<p>Note the index in this manual: use it to quickly find the information linked to a common keyword. If you still cannot find the relevant information, use the third tab page of the navigation bar to perform a full search through the manual. Of course, you should not expect WinEdt's documentation to deal with MiKTeX- or LaTeX-specific issues. Such information can be found in your TeX System's doc folder. WinEdt's Help menu by default contains an interface to a few such documents. Furthermore, a <span class="cmd">Keyword Search</span> (<span class="hk">Ctrl+F1</span>) is available: it is context sensitive and displays information pertaining to the mode of your current document (LaTeX, HTML, NSIS, etc.). Experienced users can add more mode-sensitive responses by modifying the macro script associated with this item.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
</a>

<p>WinEdt's built-in help should be your first resource in seeking support. The Help Manual reflects WinEdt's current functionality and is complemented by the topic-specific help available through the associated wizards and dialogs. In particular, WinEdt's Configuration Wizard and Execution Modes dialogs may very well guide you in resolving an early problem you might encounter! Also, consider carefully whether the problem is actually WinEdt-related and not a purely TeX question, in which case it should be posted to the appropriate forum such as the TeX Newsgroup. If, after consulting the relevant documentation, you are still unable to resolve a WinEdt-related issue, consider posting the problem on WinEdt's Mailing List (see below). As a last resort you can send a support request to <a href="mailto:support@winedt.com">support@winedt.com</a>; however, you will have to be patient because we have to deal with many such questions every day and sometimes it is impossible to keep up with the flow.</p>

<ul>
  <p><em>If you believe that you have stumbled upon a "bug" in WinEdt please describe in detail how to reproduce the problem and include as many details concerning your deviation from the default settings as possible. This way the bug can be isolated and fixed without extensive and time-consuming correspondence and days of frustrating experiments while trying to reproduce a problem on our side. Users often report as a "bug" an option in the default settings that is not set to their liking; this can be easily customized on the user's part. And remember: one user's bug another's feature!</em></p>
</ul>

<h3>WinEdt's Mailing List</h3>

<p>A good resource for information, support and assistance is WinEdt's Mailing List. You do not have to be a registered user (and, if you are, <em>you certainly should never quote your registration</em>) to participate. While the List is not moderated and some users find the traffic overwhelming, <em>it is easy to subscribe and even easier to unsubscribe:</em></p>

<p>To subscribe, send an empty message to
  <a href="mailto:winedt+list-subscribe@wsg.net">winedt+list-subscribe@wsg.net</a></p>

<p>To unsubscribe, send an empty message to
  <a href="mailto:winedt+list-unsubscribe@wsg.net">winedt+list-unsubscribe@wsg.net</a></p>

<p>To post a (hopefully non-empty) message to the list, address it to
  <a href="mailto:winedt+list@wsg.net">winedt+list@wsg.net</a></p>

<p>To get an index with subject and author for recent messages, mail:
  <a href="mailto:winedt+list-index@wsg.net">winedt+list-index@wsg.net</a></p>

<p><em>Make sure that the return address in your e-mail is correct. On subscribing you will be sent instructions on how to use the List and also on how remove yourself, should you so wish. Read these instructions carefully and avoid the embarrassment caused by sending unsubscribe requests to the forum and thus addressing a few hundred members with your request...</em></p>

<p>Topics discussed on the Mailing List should concern WinEdt. However, an occasional posting concerning TeX or other remotely related issues is an acceptable practice. If you are posting an off-topic message (non-WinEdt related), it helps if you say so before stating your question. This may spare you from being reminded that this does not strictly belong to WinEdt's Mailing List. Helpful hints and answers to typesetting problems have been given on this list in the past...</p>

<p>In addressing the List you should mention the version and build of your instance of WinEdt as displayed in the About dialog (choose <span class="cmd">About WinEdt</span> from the Help menu).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/about.png"/>
</p>

<p><tt><b>Build: </b>yyyymmdd (v. X.x)</tt> is the relevant information uniquely identifying your version of WinEdt (note that the build indicates the "<tt>year-month-day</tt>" <em>format</em> of the date when this instance of WinEdt was compiled).</p>

<p>You should also describe your problem in detail, including your Windows and (when relevant) your TeX System. You are more likely to receive good advice if you provide all the relevant information. Finally, avoid misrepresenting the situation: think twice if the error is reported by WinEdt or by TeX. Most errors about missing or misplaced .sty or .bib files or unknown graphics formats are reported by the compiler and not by WinEdt.</p>

<p>Avoid sending attachments (screenshots or other large [graphics] files) to the Mailing List. They are generally not appreciated and tend to be irrelevant to the problem you are experiencing. If you are in doubt whether or not to send your query to the Mailing List, drop a quick note to <a href="mailto:support@winedt.com">support@winedt.com</a> and we'll advise you on the matter.</p>

<p>If you are going away from your office and you are about to set up the auto-responder for your email account (a list subscriber) make sure that you first (temporarily), unsubscribe from the mailing list. If your responder generates messages back to the mailing list this can cause a never ending stream of messages and is bound to make many users (very, very) angry!</p>

<p>Sending spam messages (you know what they are) to the Mailing List is strictly forbidden!!! Exercise common sense when you are sending messages: the list is not moderated; we assume that TeX and WinEdt audience is capable of civilized and intelligent behavior.</p>

<p>Postings on WinEdt's Mailing List are also archived on gmane.org and Yahoo:</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.editors.winedt">

</blockquote>

<p><em>Anyone can search through old threads and messages to check whether such and such as question might have been discussed and answered; it is not required or necessary to be subscribed to the List to use these archives. However, be aware that the Yahoo group is for archive purposes only: you should not/cannot subscribe or send messages directly to the List via the archived group. WinEdt's Mailing List continues to be run as before with the addition of messages being archived at the above URLs for convenient searches. This service is free but as a result you'll have to put up with a few banners and advertising...</em></p>

<a name="Registration">
<h2>Registration</h2>
</a>

<p>WinEdt may be used for an evaluation period of 31 days. Any further use requires a license, obtained through the registration procedure as described below. Licensing options and conditions follow.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the licensing agreement please contact the WinEdt Team at <a href="mailto:orders@winedt.com">orders@winedt.com</a>. You can also inquire about alternative methods of ordering a license for WinEdt. We accept purchase orders and we offer a wide range of payment options (PayPal, cheques, money orders, foreign currency, direct bank deposits, etc...). Email inquiries are answered in a timely fashion.</p>

<p><i>To avoid misunderstandings and confusion you should always include the version and build number of your copy of WinEdt as displayed in the About dialog (choose <span class="cmd">About WinEdt</span> from the Help menu) with your orders or queries. This facilitates in sending you the appropriate registration code and any relevant information pertaining to your version of the program.</i></p>

<HR/>

<h3>Using the on-line Web Store</h3>

<p>The Web Store is available through the Registration page of our web site; it is a portal administered by eSellerate and owned by Digital River/RegNet. It is to be used for ordering with a credit card transaction. To use this service, follow the link below and first read the "Directions for On-line Purchasing"; then choose your license and proceed. <em>Note that the Web Store appears to be the property of the WinEdt Team; indeed, your receipt will show our address and inform you that your credit card statement will show a transaction from "DRI*WINEDT INC." It is in fact DRI (Digital River) that charges the card.</em> The process is automatic in that you immediately get an order confirmation; and we too receive a notification of your order. However, <em>your receipt will not contain your registration, which comes directly from us</em>; and we are not automated, so you will have to wait for our email with your license data...</p>

<p>The Web Store also offers an optional CD (latest official version), burned and shipped from eSellerate in the US. Potential buyers of the CD should be aware that there are no WinEdt- or TeX-related extras on the CD beyond the download available on our site.</p>

<h3>Trial Period</h3>

<p>Your copy of the program becomes licensed after you enter your data and press <span class="cmd">OK</span> as prompted. Note that you don't have to reinstall WinEdt (you can keep the copy that you have tried and possibly customized during the trial period). Entering the registration data will suppress any registration reminders (if your registration is overdue); it will also remove the text, "Unregistered Copy", from WinEdt's caption and reduce the size of the first panel in the status line.</p>

<p><i>The WinEdt Team does not provide support by the phone! To contact us you have to use e-mail: <a href="mailto:support@winedt.com">support@winedt.com</a>.</i></p>

<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>

<p>The information collected by the WinEdt Team in the process of registration is private and confidential; it is not and will not be made available to any other individual or organization. A database of registered users is kept for the purpose of identifying legitimate upgrade requests. We do not send any non-solicited (spam) messages; nor do we issue by email notifications regarding the availability of new versions of WinEdt and/or companion tools. The Mailing List and WinEdt's Home Page are the places where interested users can obtain any such information.</p>
