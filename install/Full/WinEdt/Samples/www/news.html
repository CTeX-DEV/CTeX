<h1>WinEdt 10</h1>

<p>WinEdt 10 is a Unicode text editor with code folding capability. Users that already have an older version of WinEdt should read the following important information pertaining to upgrading:</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> WinEdt 10 does not run on Windows XP. Windows 7 or later is required for this version to run on your computer! This version was developed and extensively tested on Windows 10.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WinEdt 10 is installed parallel to WinEdt 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 and you can continue to use an older version of WinEdt and possibly uninstall WinEdt 10 if you prefer the old version. WinEdt 10 can run simultaneously with an older version of the program. You should <em>not</em> attempt to install WinEdt 10 <em>over</em> the existing WinEdt 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 on your system!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Upgrading:</b> From version 5.x -- not really; you cannot import old settings from WinEdt 5: the new version will have to be customized from scratch! Some configuration (*.ini) files from WinEdt 6 can be loaded into WinEdt 10 after some modifications (with many exceptions that affect Unicode and Language functionality). If you already have WinEdt 9 installed the migration is easy: just execute the command 'Import WinEdt 9 Settings' from within WinEdt 10 and you're done...</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Upgrading WinEdt 10 series is easy. Install the new version or build (when available) over the older instance of WinEdt 10 and execute the command 'Upgrade Personal Configuration' to merge your custom settings with the new defaults.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Registration:</b> WinEdt 10 series uses the same registration data as WinEdt 6, 7,8, and 9  -- you will have to enter the same registration data in WinEdt 10. If you are currently using WinEdt 5 you can take advantage of the trial period and see if you want to use this version or you prefer the older WinEdt 5.x series. Should you opt for WinEdt 10 and already have a license for WinEdt 5, you will need to purchase an upgrade license from www.winedt.com (see the Tables at the Registration page: upgrade rates are at the bottom). Exceptions will be made (upon request) to users that have purchased a license or an upgrade within the last year and to (a few) users that make contributions to <a href="http://www.winedt.org">winedt.org</a>, or help with WinEdt project in some other way... This is your chance to get involved!</p>

<p>WinEdt 10 uses dictionaries (word lists) in <em>unicode</em> format: they can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.winedt.org">winedt.org</a>. Properly converted English dictionaries are already included in the default settings.</p>

<p><b>Major new features in WinEdt 10:</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <li>The major new feature in this version is the ability to handle bidirectional text (Arabic or Hebrew) and improved support for some complex unicode scripts (such as <em>Thai</em>). The use of MS <a href="uniscribe.html">Uniscribe</a> library in WinEdt's text processing engine is instrumental for this functionality (also the main reason why this version doesn't run on Windows XP that does not support unicode script tags)...
  </li><br/>
  <li>The [UNICODE] section has plenty of new properties pertaining to the use Uniscribe library including some pretty fancy formatting options and mixing of fonts as highlighting attributes. These features are by default enabled for HTML mode. Check the new HTML project samples in Document -> Samples -> www Menu to see this functionality in action...
  </li><br/>
  <li>Document Tabs now allow an extra 0/1 property SHOW_HINTS. When enabled the full path and filename of a document is displayed as a hint when mouse pointer hovers over the tab. Document Tab hints are by default enabled.
  </li><br/>
  <li>An "old" problem with MiKTeX's "Install Packages on Demand" functionality when running console applications inside WinEdt console has been fixed (regardless of whether the packages are installed on user or system level with UAC and regardless of MiKTeX asking for conformation or not). It turns out that MiKTeX's accessories (except TeXify) cannot initiate download and installation of missing packages with any kind of prompt if the process was created within invisible (hidden) console Window (it is not clear why: a bug in MiKTeX). However, the way around this problem is NOT to create (and then hide) an external console Window at all. Simple enough, once you find out what exactly is the matter...
  </li><br/>
  <li>PDF macros no longer use DDE for SumatraPDF. Using the command line switch -forward-search is faster and more reliable. Using a command line switch (if it exists) is always preferable (simple is better). Besides DDE does not (and will not) support Unicode!
  </li><br/>
  <li>There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of WinEdt 10 available. Users with 64-bit Windows can install either. Configurations and functionality of both versions are identical. The only difference is that WinEdt.exe is compiled as a native 32-bit or 64-bit Windows application, respectively. In the long run all applications will use a 64-bit platform but currently 32-bit applications run well on 64-bit Windows and not all applications offer a stable 64-bit version yet... 64-bit applications can launch 32-bit ones and vice versa. That's why both versions of WinEdt will work with either 32-bit or 64-bit version of other applications...
  </li><br/>
  <li><em>And there is more...</em> As always, plenty of work has gone into this version of WinEdt and every aspect of the code, documentation, and default settings has been revised and improved for this release. See WinEdt 10 Change Log below for details...
  </li>
