<p>WinEdt is a powerful and versatile all-purpose text editor for Windows with a strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents...</p>

<p>WinEdt is used as a front-end for compilers and typesetting systems, such as TeX, HTML or NSIS. WinEdt's highlighting schemes can be customized for different modes and its spell checking functionality supports multilingual setups, with dictionaries (word lists) for many languages available on WinEdt's Community Site <a href="http://www.winedt.org">www.winedt.org</a>. <em>Contributions are welcome!</em></p>

<p><i>Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt has been specifically designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with a TeX System (such as <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MiKTeX</a> or <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>). However, WinEdt's documentation does not cover TeX-related topics in depth; you'll find introductions and manuals on typesetting with TeX, as well as links to other recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site (<a href="http://www.tug.org">TUG</a>). For LaTeX-related issues visit <a href="http://latex-community.org/">LaTeX Community Forum</a>: questions are welcome and help is forthcoming!</i></p>

<H2><span class="new">New:</span> WinEdt 10.0</H2>

<p>WinEdt 10.0 is now the <em>official</em> version of the program. It supports (customizable) <em>auto completion</em> and <em>code folding</em>, it is unicode/utf8-capable, and it integrates seamlessly with the latest accessories and TeX Systems (such as SumatraPDF viewer, MiKTeX 2.9 and TeX Live 2015). It has been extensively tested under Windows 10, 8 and 7 (32-bit <em>and</em> 64-bit).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WinEdt is compatible with Windows High Contrast Schemes. It <em>is</em> compliant with Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act <a target="top" href="http://www.section508.gov/">&sect;1194.22</a>. Furthermore, WinEdt is <em>dpi-aware</em>: it comes with high-quality graphic resources at different sizes and it automatically adjusts its GUI to high-resolution displays (without stretched or blurred graphics and text)...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This version uses the powerful <a href="uniscribe.html">Uniscribe</a> library in order to better handle Unicode and complex language processing (including support for bidirectional text). It also contains improved integration with the latest versions of MiKTeX (including proper support for MiKTeX's "Install packages on demand" feature when running TeX accessories in WinEdt console).
<em>And there is <a href="log.html">more</a>...</em></p>

<p>To install WinEdt 10.0 follow the link below and proceed according to the instructions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href="news.html">WinEdt 10.0 [Build: 20160317]</a>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Hint: </b> For <em>legacy reasons</em> WinEdt by default features a large 2-row toolbar with interface to numerous TeX accessories and previewers (as still used by many long-time users). Through the Options menu it is easy to switch to one of the predefined 1-row toolbars. For most users this is a <em>better</em> starting point (it can be further customized as explained in WinEdt Documentation and <a href="download.html#Quick_Guide">Quick Guide</a>)...</p>

<p><em>Once installed, don't forget to check WinEdt's (updated and revised) Help and Documentation (including the new <a href="download.html#Quick_Guide">Quick Guide</a>). A few sections in User's Guide explain how to set up your LaTeX projects in order to take full advantage of WinEdt's capabilities when it comes to navigating in large projects or collecting data for purpose of referencing and citations. If used properly WinEdt will make your TeX-ing more enjoyable by allowing you to focus on the contents of your documents while assisting you with typesetting-related tasks...</em></p>
