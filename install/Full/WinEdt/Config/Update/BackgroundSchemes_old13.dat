// If you enable this "black" scheme you will want to disable Environment
// Backgrounds in the Preferences| Highlighting Dialog...
// Alternatively, you will have to adjust environment background colors in
// Switches.ini so as to make them applicable to black background!
// Fine tuning may require adjusting other highlighting colors as well unless
// you limit highlighting to Font Attributes Only (Preferences| Highlighting Dialog).

// On Win7 or Win8 enabling one of Dark High Contrast Windows Schemes in the
// Control Panel might be a better solution if you prefer consistent dark colors!
