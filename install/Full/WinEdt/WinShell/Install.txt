WinEdt 10 has been Installed on your System
==========================================

This is the default configuration (project file is not loaded
during the installation - it will be loaded after you restart the
program). To finish the installation proceed as follows:

Start the Configuration Wizard (Options Menu):

  - (Optionally) Create or update any filetype associations.
    WinEdt has to be run with (elevated) Administrator Privileges
    for this to work on Vista or Windows 7, 8 or 10! This is a good
    time to perform this task while WinEdt has elevated status...

  - Restart WinEdt to finish the installation!

NOTE: You must restart WinEdt to load your personal configuration
before you start customizing your settings!!!

UPGRADING ISSUES:
=================

WinEdt 10 is installed parallel to WinEdt 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 and you
can continue to use an older version of WinEdt and possibly
uninstall WinEdt 10 if you prefer the old version.

NOTE: WinEdt 10 does not run on Windows XP. Windows 7 or later is
required for this version to run on your computer! This version was
developed and extensively tested on Windows 10...

IMPORTANT: If you already have WinEdt 5.x, 6, 7 or 8 on your system
you cannot import your old settings directly into WinEdt 10! If you
already have WinEdt 9 installed the migration is easy: just execute
the command 'Import WinEdt 9 Settings' from within WinEdt 10 and
you're done...

  Upgrading from WinEdt 10.0 is easy:

    Close WinEdt and install the new version over the old one.
    Executing the command 'Upgrade Personal Configuration' will
    merge your custom WinEdt 10 settings with the new defaults...

REGISTRATION: WinEdt 10 series uses the same Registration Data as
WinEdt 9, 8, 7 and 6. You will, however, have to enter the data
(Name and Code) again in the Registration Dialog of WinEdt 10.
WinEdt 5 users will have to pay an upgrade fee if they want to
register WinEdt 10 (see www.winedt.com for details).
