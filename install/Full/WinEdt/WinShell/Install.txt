WinEdt 9 has been Installed on your System
==========================================

This is the default configuration (project file is not loaded
during the installation - it will be loaded after you restart the
program). To finish the installation proceed as follows:

Start the Configuration Wizard (Options Menu):

  - (Optionally) Create or update any filetype associations.
    WinEdt has to be run with (elevated) Administrator Privileges
    for this to work on Vista or Windows 7 or 8! This is a good
    time to perform this task while WinEdt has elevated status...

  - Restart WinEdt to finish the installation!

NOTE: You must restart WinEdt to load your personal configuration
before you start customizing your settings!!!

UPGRADING ISSUES:
=================

WinEdt 9 is installed parallel to WinEdt 8, 7, 6 or 5 and you can
continue to use an older version of WinEdt and possibly uninstall
WinEdt 9 if you prefer the old version.

IMPORTANT: If you already have WinEdt 5.x, 6 or 7 on your system
you cannot import your old settings directly into WinEdt 9! If you
already have WinEdt 8 installed the migration is easy: just execute
the command 'Import WinEdt 8 Settings' from within WinEdt 9 and
you're done...

    Upgrading WinEdt 9 series from here on will be easy since your
    local settings are preserved during upgrades. Executing the
    command 'Upgrade Personal Configuration' will merge your custom
    settings with the new defaults.

REGISTRATION: WinEdt 9 series uses the same Registration Data as
WinEdt 8, 7 and 6. You will, however, have to enter the data (Name
and Code) again in the Registration Dialog of WinEdt 9. WinEdt 5
users will have to pay an upgrade fee if they want to register
WinEdt 9 (see www.winedt.com for details).
