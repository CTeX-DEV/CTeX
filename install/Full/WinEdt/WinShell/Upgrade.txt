WinEdt 9 has been Reinstalled or Upgraded on your System
========================================================

This is the default configuration (project file is not loaded
during the installation - it will be loaded after you restart the
program). To finish the installation upgrade proceed as follows:

Start the Configuration Wizard (Options Menu):

  - (Optionally) Create or update any filetype associations.
    WinEdt has to be run with (elevated) Administrator Privileges
    for this to work on Vista or Windows 7 or 8! This is a good
    time to perform this task while WinEdt has elevated status...

  - Restart WinEdt NOW in order to finish the installation!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have upgraded over an older version of WinEdt 9 your local
settings have been preserved. However, after restarting WinEdt you
should execute the

  Options -> Maintenance -> Upgrade Personal Configuration

menu command in order to merge your custom settings with the new
defaults.
