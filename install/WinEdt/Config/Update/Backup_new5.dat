// Specify 0..9 if you want WinEdt to maintain file history in
// *.~0.bak ... *.~9.bak (newest ... oldest) files.
// History files are maintained in the same directory as backup.
// %!b\_history\%u\%n%t.bak is a good specification for this purpose:
// out of sight out of mind (until you need to restore an older version)!
// Use Documents Menu -> BAK File to open the last backup and history files
// are in the same folder (with dates when they have been created)...
// Value -1 disables this functionality!
KEEP_HISTORY=9

// Create Backup for .dnt and .prj files next to the originals!
