// WinEdt can check if any of its documents have been externally
// modified. If you notice that as a consequence of enabling this
// option WinEdt is using extra CPU then you should increase the
// timer interval or exclude any problematic devices from such
// functionality by listing only fast devices in the FAST_DEVICES
// filter...

// Sometimes a document or a file in your window can be modified
// by another user or application. If the "Update" option is
// enabled for a document WinEdt detects such an event and alerts
// you about the situation, thus giving you a chance to update
// your document or take any other action. If you are also working
// on drives with slow access (such as floppy disks) or remote
// network drives and you don't want to experience any delays, you
// can exempt such drives from this feature by specifying the
// admissible ones in the filter as "FAST_DEVICES". Usually the
// FAST_DEVICES filter will read: "C;D" (enabled for drives C and
// D) or "*|A" (enabled for all drives except for [floppy?] drive "A")...

// Some menu items are only enabled when certain files exist (eg.
// the dvips accessory requires the existence of the .dvi file).
// This is a nice feature but it can slow down WinEdt if you are
// working on a drive where verifying the existence of files is
// slow. There should be no problem with hard drive C or D but
// again, floppy, zip or some network drives can be problematic. If you
// experience problems with WinEdt's performance enable the option
// "IGNORE_REQUIRED_FILES_MENU_ATTRIBUTE" and list the problematic
// drives in SLOW_DEVICES filter (eg. "A;B;Z" or "*|C;D")...
