[INCREMENTAL_SEARCH]

// ===============================================================================
// The Following Options can be adjusted with checkboxes in the Inc Search Dialog

// Case Sensitive?
CASE_SENSITIVE=0

// When enabled, multiple spaces within a string are ignored.
// For example: "This is"  =  "This   is".
RELAXED_SPACING=1

// When enabled, the search will be performed on all opened documents.
ALL_DOCUMENTS=0

// If disabled, Search will match a string when it is split over one line; for
// example, the string "this is" will be found even if "this" and "is" aren't on
// the same line. When checked, Search will find instances of the specified string
// only if they are in the same line.
INLINE_EXPRESSIONS_ONLY=1

// ===============================================================================
// The Following Options can be adjusted through the popup menu in the
// Inc Search Dialog

// When enabled, the search starts at the current position to the end of the
// document and continues from the top to the initial position. That is, Search
// will begin at and end at your initial position. This can come in handy when you
// want to ensure that you did not miss any instances of a string in a document.
// Incremental Search is always cyclic when its scope is set to "All Documents".
CYCLIC_SEARCH=1

// This option instructs WinEdt to start incremental search from scratch:
// the stack of found instances from the previous search is discarded and the
// current position is assumed to be the start of a new search.
// If disabled, then the previous search continues until it is explicitly reset by
// pressing the "Search for" (Alt+S) button on the left of the edit control...
// This option has no effect if the interface is executed as a non-modal dialog.
RESET_INC_SEARCH=1

// This option instructs WinEdt to start the Incremental Search
// Dialog with an empty string. This option implies "Reset Inc
// Search". This option has no effect if the interface is executed
// as a non-modal dialog.
ERASE_STRING=1

// This option instructs WinEdt to start the Incremental Search
// Dialog with the previous string selected. This makes it easy to
// either continue searching or type any character to start a new
// search. This option has no effect if the "Erase String" option
// is enabled (there is nothing to select). This option is usually
// combined with "Reset Inc Search". This option has no effect if
// the interface is executed as a non-modal dialog.
SELECT_STRING=1

// When a string within aa line is selected this option causes the
// string to be initially displayed in the Find Dialog.
AUTO_SELECT=0

// When this option is enabled it is not possible to type or paste
// a string that can not be found. This is how proper incremental
// search works. However, some users prefer to paste any string,
// edit it and then use Next and Previous commands to find
// instances of edited string. This option should be disabled if
// this is how you fancy incremental search to work...
MUST_EXIST=1

// When this option is enabled the Next and Previous Command
// display a prompt stating that the string is not found when
// there is no further match. If you decide to disable the Must
// Exist option you may consider enabling this one....
PROMPT=0

// When enabled the Incremental Search Interface is executed as a
// modal dialog. That is you cannot enter any text in documents
// until the dialog is closed. When this option is disabled a more
// common behavior for incremental search is established. Only
// text input and the Backspace command are processed by the
// dialog's edit control. Any other command closes the interface
// and focuses the top document. Subsequent search can be done
// with the "Search Again" (F3) command. Even if the interface is
// executed as modal dialog pressing F3 in the dialog closes the
// interface and allows subsequent use of "Search Again" command.
MODAL_DIALOG=0

// When Enabled the dialog will stay on top when you click on a document
// This options has no effect for Modal Dialog...
STAY_ON_TOP=1

// When enabled, the interface is displayed in top-left corner of
// WinEdt's main window.
LOCKED_POSITION=1

// Floating (not Locked Position) (Top/Left Corner)
TOP=0
LEFT=0
