<p>WinEdt is a powerful and versatile all-purpose text editor for Windows with a strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents...</p>

<p>WinEdt is used as a front-end for compilers and typesetting systems, such as TeX, HTML or NSIS. WinEdt's highlighting schemes can be customized for different modes and its spell checking functionality supports multilingual setups, with dictionaries (word lists) for many languages available on WinEdt's Community Site <a href="http://www.winedt.org">www.winedt.org</a>. <em>Contributions are welcome!</em></p>

<p><i>Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt has been specifically designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with a TeX System (such as <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MiKTeX</a> or <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>). However, WinEdt's documentation does not cover TeX-related topics in depth; you'll find introductions and manuals on typesetting with TeX, as well as links to other recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site (<a href="http://www.tug.org">TUG</a>). For LaTeX-related issues visit <a href="http://latex-community.org/">LaTeX Community Forum</a>: questions are welcome and help is forthcoming!</i></p>

<H2><span class="new">New:</span> WinEdt 9.0</H2>

<p>WinEdt 9.0 is now the <em>official</em> version of the program. It supports (customizable) <em>code folding</em>, it is <em>unicode-capable</em>, and it integrates seamlessly with the latest accessories and TeX Systems (such as MiKTeX 2.9 and TeX Live 2014). It has been extensively tested under Windows 7, <em>and</em> 8 (32-bit <em>and</em> 64-bit). Furthermore, WinEdt 9 is compatible with Windows High Contrast Schemes and it is <em>dpi-aware</em>: it automatically adjusts its GUI to (ultra) high resolution displays. WinEdt 9 comes with <em>new</em> high-quality graphic resources at different sizes  (suitable for different display resolutions)...</p>

<p><em>Once installed, don't forget to check WinEdt's (updated and revised) Help and Documentation. A few sections in User's Guide explain how to set up your LaTeX projects in order to take full advantage of WinEdt's capabilities when it comes to navigating in large projects or collecting data for purpose of referencing and citations. If used properly WinEdt will make your TeX-ing more enjoyable by allowing you to focus on the contents of your documents while transparently taking care of typesetting-related tasks...</em></p>
