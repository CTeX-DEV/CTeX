<p>WinEdt is a powerful and versatile text editor for Windows with a strong predisposition towards the creation of LaTeX documents...</p>

<p>WinEdt is used as a front-end for compilers and typesetting systems, such as TeX, HTML or NSIS. WinEdt's highlighting schemes can be customized for different modes and its spell checking functionality supports multilingual setups, with dictionaries (word lists) for many languages available for downloading from WinEdt's Community Site <a href="http://www.winedt.org">www.winedt.org</a>. <em>Contributions are welcome!</em></p>

<p><i>Although reasonably suitable as an all-purpose text editor, WinEdt has been specifically designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with a TeX System (such as <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MiKTeX</a> or <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>). However, WinEdt's documentation does not cover TeX-related topics in depth; you'll find introductions and manuals on typesetting with TeX, as well as links to other recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site (<a href="http://www.tug.org">TUG</a>). For LaTeX-related issues visit <a href="http://latex-community.org/">LaTeX Community Forum</a>: questions are welcome and help is forthcoming!</i></p>

<p>WinEdt 9.0 is now the <em>official</em> version of the program. It is <em>unicode-capable</em> and integrates seamlessly with the latest accessories and TeX Systems (MiKTeX 2.9 and TeX Live 2014). It has been extensively tested under Windows 7 and 8 (32-bit and 64-bit).</p>

<p><em>Don't forget to check WinEdt's (updated and revised) help and documentation. Sections in the User's Guide explain how to set up your LaTeX projects in order to take full advantage of WinEdt's capabilities when it comes to navigating in large projects or collecting data for purpose of referencing and citations. If used properly, WinEdt will make your TeX-ing more enjoyable by allowing you to focus on the contents of your documents while transparently taking care of typesetting-related tasks...</em></p>
