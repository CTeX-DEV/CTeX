Version 1.9 is a modification of 1.8h to recognise excessive space in 
"ashow" as being a word separator, as found output from groff 1.08. 
Also fixed widthshow, awidthshow and added xshow, yshow and xyshow.  
Uses ANSI prototypes.  These are now required, not optional.
Fixes a number of compiler warnings.
Note that neither of the original authors still work at DEC/Compaq/HP.
